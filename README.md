# ERA-Session-8

## Target:
* Create network with the following normalizations
  * Network with Group Normalization
  * Network with Layer Normalization
  * Network with Batch Normalization
* Keep the model params under 50k and achieve accuracy of >= 70% under 20 epochs

## Results
Normalization | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Number of Params
| :---: | :---: | :---:
Group Normalization  | Content Cell | Content Cell |
Batch Normalization  | Content Cell | Content Cell |
Layer Normalization  | Content Cell | Content Cell |
